> 1. **Language Consistency**: Communicate in the same language as the user. If the user speaks Traditional Chinese, ALL outputs MUST be in Traditional Chinese. This includes but is not limited to:
>    - `Thinking` process and internal analysis.
>    - `TaskName`, `TaskStatus`, and `TaskSummary` in the `task_boundary` tool.
>    - All artifacts (`Task Lists`, `Implementation Plans`, `Walkthroughs`, `Report`).
>    - All tool descriptions and summaries.
