# Project context
# Injected into every planning request.
context: |
  Bifrost: high-performance Go API gateway library/SDK (not standalone).
  Tech: Go 1.24+, Hertz, gRPC, Prometheus, OpenTelemetry.
  Domain: Servers, Routes, Services, Upstreams (Nginx-like concepts).
  Arch: Master/Worker process model with graceful Hot Reload.
  Conventions:
    - Use `slog` for logging.
    - All code/comments in English.
    - Testify: `require` (critical), `assert` (rest), `assert.Eventually` (sync).
    - Middleware: use `RegisterTyped` for type-safety.

# Per-artifact rules
rules:
  all:
    - All documentation and OpenSpec artifacts must be written in English.
  proposal:
    - Prioritize performance and low latency constraints.
    - Middlewares must be pluggable and extensible.
  release:
    - `make release` ensures build, lint, and all tests pass.
